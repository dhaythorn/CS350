# CS350
This project involved developing an embedded thermostat control system using a Raspberry Pi and Python to interface with temperature sensors and output devices. The goal was to simulate a smart thermostat capable of reading real-time environmental data, processing it through software logic, and activating control mechanisms (such as LEDs or fans) to maintain a target temperature. 
I implemented the control logic cleanly and used modular programming techniques to separate hardware communication from application logic. My use of state-based decision-making made the system predictable and easier to debug. I also integrated serial communication effectively, ensuring the program could respond quickly to sensor input and user commands without lag or blocking behavior.
In future iterations, I would improve the scalability and configuration management of the project. Right now, temperature thresholds and hardware pin assignments are hardcoded, but they could be externalized to a configuration file or a database. I would also enhance error handling to make the system more resilient to sensor disconnections or unexpected input.
Throughout this project, I became more comfortable using Python’s RPi.GPIO and adafruit libraries for hardware interfacing. I also used the Raspberry Pi documentation and the Adafruit AHTx0 sensor library. These resources will remain part of my toolkit for future embedded projects.
The most transferable skills from this project include hardware–software integration, event-driven programming, and system modularization. The ability to break down a complex control problem into a maintainable, layered system will apply directly to future coursework in embedded systems, IoT development, and even large-scale software architecture.
I kept the code organized with clear function definitions, consistent naming conventions, and in-code documentation describing each section’s purpose. I also structured the project so that new sensors or actuators could be added with minimal modification.
